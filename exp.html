        Every year the preschools in the area provide a vision screening for early detection for all of their
students. We got to practice age appropriate techniques while still providing a useful service to detect
any children with possible vision problems. Any child that presented like there may be a problem was
then referred to an eye doctor and their parents were notified. Parents were also given a list of
resources they could utilize for potentially getting help.

      <p>We participated in a Health fair at a local elementary school to teach children about the importance of proper nutrition and exercise. Using the MyPlate guidelines, we had age appropriate games made for
the different grade levels to help them learn how to pick proper nutritional food, as opposed to junk
food. It was a very interactive presentation that all the children seemed to enjoy and learn from.</p>
