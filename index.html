        <h2>Nursing Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          Strive to provide competent and evidence based practice care, always pursuing a path that leads to the best patient outcome. Commitment to a lifetime of learning and continuing education to ensure the safe implementation of new technologies, medications, and policy. Always striving to provide the highest level of care to people from all walks of life while remaining objective, non-judgmental, and non-prejudiced, regardless of where they come from. Nurture the sacred nurse-patient relationship to build trust and understanding so that you may act as a conduit between the patient and the medical team. Understand that we are caring for people who often times present to us at the worst possible moment in their lives, and it is my job to speak when they cannot be heard, and always stay grounded in the role as an advocate for what they need or want. It is my personal vow and duty as a nurse to always provide
 care in that manner.
